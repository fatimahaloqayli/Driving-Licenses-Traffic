 Local Traffic, Statistical Summaries and Inference(Fatimah)




### Overview

To achieve this project it was necessary to work on:

- basic statistics (distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing)
- many Python programming concepts
- programmatically interacting with files and directories
- visualizations
- EDA
- working with Jupyter notebooks for development and reporting


### Datasets

For this project, there are two datasets:

- [Traffic Accidents and Casualties by Region](/data/saudi-arabia-traffic-accidents-and-casualties-injured-dead-2008.csv)
- [Driving Licenses Issued By Administrative Area](/data/saudi-arabia-driving-licenses-issued-in-the-kingdom-2004-2008.csv)

You can see the source for the accident data [here](https://datasource.kapsarc.org/explore/dataset/saudi-arabia-traffic-accidents-and-casualties-injured-dead-2008/), and the source for the license data [here](https://datasource.kapsarc.org/explore/dataset/saudi-arabia-traffic-accidents-and-casualties-injured-dead-2008/).

| 'year' | int64 | accidents | The year where the triffic accidents exist|
| 'geo_point_2d_x' | float64 | accidents | The x corrdinate where the traffic accidents|
| 'geo_point_2d_y' | float64 | accidents | The y corrdinate where the traffic accidents|
| 'num_of_accidents' | int64 | accidents | The number of accidents exist per year/regoin|
| 'num_of_dead' | int64 | accidents | The number of deads per year/regoin|
| 'num_of_injured' | int64 | accidents | The number of injured people per year/regoin|
| 'region' | object | license | The region where the triffic accidents exist|
| 'year' | int64 | license | The year where the triffic accidents exist|
| 'driving_licenses' | int64 | license |The number of driving liceses per year/regoin|
| 'geo_point_2d_x' | float64 | license | The x corrdinate where the traffic accidents|
| 'geo_point_2d_y' | float64 | license | The y corrdinate where the traffic accidents|


### Deliverables

This project comprise of a written technical report:
- A Jupyter notebook that describes your data with visualizations & statistical analysis.
- A README markdown file the provides an introduction to and overview of your project.
- A blog post in Arabic or English that showcases the problem and key findings of this project. More information will be given on this.
